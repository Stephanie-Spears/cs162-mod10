<p>Finally, this week also marks the end of this class, so the final exam is now due. Please note that the final xam covers the following chapters:</p>
<ul>
<li>an overview</li>
<li>basic elements of c++</li>
<li>input/output</li>
<li>control structures</li>
<li>user-defined functions</li>

<li>arrays</li>
<li>records</li>
<li>classes and data abstraction</li>
<li>pointers</li>
<li>linked lists</li>
<li>recursion</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike the chapter quizzes, you will have only <em><strong>one attempt</strong></em> at the final exam, so be sure you are ready and your internet connection is working properly before you begin. Good luck!</p>
<p>The class that follows this one is CS260 (or CS163 in PSU), Data Structure. You will learn more about how to organize a collection of data and their pros/cons. If you have questions about which classes to take or transfer related issue, you are welcome to email <a href="http://spot.pcc.edu/computers/">Michele Maxwell</a>, the student advisor in our division. At this point, you are ready to work as an intern. If you are interested in job opportunities, please contact <a href="http://spot.pcc.edu/comptech/">Gary Coleman</a>, the career specialist for computer technology. I truly enjoy having you here. Thank you!</p>
